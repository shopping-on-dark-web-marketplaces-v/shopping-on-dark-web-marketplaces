Whether you're new to the scene or a seasoned user, this wiki provides essential knowledge and tools to navigate these platforms securely and efficiently.  Learn how to shop safely and anonymously.

##  Introduction to Darknet Marketplaces

Darknet marketplaces offer a unique shopping experience, providing anonymity and access to a wide range of goods and services. These markets operate on the darknet, accessed via the Tor network, which ensures user privacy through layers of encryption.  Cryptocurrency payments, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR), are standard, offering additional privacy benefits.

### Key Features of Darknet Marketplaces:

*   **Cryptocurrency Payments**: Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) are primarily accepted, with Monero favored for increased privacy.
*   **Onion Links & Mirrors**: Access is provided through unique `.onion` URLs and mirror sites to maintain access and protect against downtime.
*   **Escrow Services**: Escrow systems hold funds until the buyer confirms receipt, minimizing fraud risks.
*   **Security Measures**: PGP encryption for secure messaging and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for account security are standard.

## Getting Started:  Creating an Account

Before you can start shopping, you'll need to create an account on the marketplace. The process typically involves a few straightforward steps.

### Account Creation:
1.  **Access the Market**: Use the Tor Browser to connect to the verified `.onion` URL of the marketplace.
2.  **Choose a Username & Password**: Select a unique username and create a strong, complex password to protect your account.
3.  **Enable 2FA**: Set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for added security. This usually involves a 6-digit code.
4.  **PGP Key**: You'll often need to provide your PGP public key for encrypted communications.
5.  **Secure Backup**: Store your mnemonic recovery phrase in a safe place to regain access to your account.
